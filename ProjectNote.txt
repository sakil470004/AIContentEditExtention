New Project Assignments:

Local Logging & Dashboard Prototype:
– Objective: Implement a simple client-side logging system using localStorage to capture prompt submissions and system events.
– Task: Build a lightweight dashboard (as a modal or separate page) that reads and displays these logs in real time.
– Deadline: Initial prototype within 1 week.
Done

UI/UX Refinement:
– Objective: Refine the current header, footer, and prompt modal design for better visual harmony with ChatGPT’s interface.
– Task: Tweak colors, fonts, and spacing to ensure a seamless integration.
– Deadline: Feedback cycle and updates over the next 3-4 days.
Done

Identity & Data Safeguards Concept Paper:
– Objective: Draft a proposal outlining our approach to secure, decentralized identity management and immutable logging for the forum platform.
– Task: Research potential tools (e.g., localStorage, IndexedDB, and future decentralized options) and document best practices.
– Deadline: First draft in 1 week.
In Progress

System Feedback Loop Enhancements:
– Objective: Develop a plan to integrate real-time feedback and status metrics into the interface, so that system health and engagement can be monitored visually.
– Task: Outline possible visual cues (like status indicators in the header) and implement basic logging to feed these metrics.
– Deadline: Initial plan and prototype within 1 week.
